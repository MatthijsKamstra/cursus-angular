TypeScript - Arrays

An array is a special type of data type which can store multiple values of different data types sequentially using a special syntax.

TypeScript supports arrays, similar to JavaScript. There are two ways to declare an array:

1. Using square brackets. This method is similar to how you would declare arrays in JavaScript.

let fruits: string[] = ['Apple', 'Orange', 'Banana'];

2. Using a generic array type, Array<elementType>.

let fruits: Array<string> = ['Apple', 'Orange', 'Banana'];
